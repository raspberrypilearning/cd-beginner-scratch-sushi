## Introduction

These Sushi Cards are going to help you learn to create computer programs in Scratch!

### What you will make

You will make a game where you move a shark around to try and catch fish.

Here's an example of how your finished game might look:

<div class="scratch-preview">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/205355052/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

Press the green flag to start the game. Use the arrow keys to move the shark around and catch the fish.
