## The Scratch window
Once you sign-in to the online Scratch, or load it on your computer, you’ll see a screen like the one below.

This screen has a few parts you’ll need to remember. They are labeled in the picture below.

There are a few words from that picture that need explaining:

### The Stage

This is where your Scratch Programs run. It has
* One or more backgrounds (images on the background of the screen)
* Any code blocks associated with it (we’ll get to this)

### Sprites

Any object that goes on the stage is a sprite. In Scratch, the sprite is:
* The image on the stage
* Any alternative costumes (looks) it has
* Any sounds associated with it
* Any code blocks associated with it

The current sprite is the one that’s selected in the sprite list.

### Code Blocks
Code in Scratch comes as blocks, that you click together to make programs. You choose blocks from the code blocks pale8e and drag them into the current sprite panel, then click them together.
There are 10 categories of blocks, which are colour coded, and you can select each category from the list at the top of the code blocks palette.
