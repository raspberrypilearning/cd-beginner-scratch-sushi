## Start coding!

Time to get coding!

* Go back to Scratch and click on the Scratch Cat in the **sprite list**. The cat is now the **current sprite**.
* Go to the **Events** category in the **code blocks palette** and choose the “when [flag symbol] clicked” event, then drag it onto the **current sprite panel**.
* Then go to **Looks** in the **code blocks palette** and choose the “say [Hello!] for [2] secs” block and drag it onto the **current sprite panel**, connecting it to the end of the other block, like this: 

    ```blocks
    when green flag clicked
    say [Hello!] for (2) secs
    ```

* Now click the Start Program button and watch what happens!
