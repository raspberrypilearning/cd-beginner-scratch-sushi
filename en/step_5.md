## Looking cool

So your cat moves up and down, as well as left to right. You should probably put it somewhere sensible for that... like under water! Scratch has a library of backgrounds and sprites for you to use to make your project look awesome.

+ Select the stage.

+ Click on **Backdrops**.

+ Then pick your favourite underwater background!

Great! Of course, now you have a cat underwater. Cats arenâ€™t usually big fans of that, but you can fix that. You can turn the cat into a shark!

+ First, select the cat and click on the **Costumes** tab
